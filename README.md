📊 Global Inflation Risk Analysis Dashboard
🧠 Project Overview

Global Inflation Risk Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive Data Analytics project built using Microsoft Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize global inflation rates from 1980 to 2024.

The project transforms complex, unstructured macroeconomic data into a multi-page, interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights into volatility trends, geographic risk concentration, and the performance of key risk mitigation mechanisms.

❗ The Problem

Global inflation datasets are often unstructured, wide-format, and highly volatile, making it challenging for analysts and policymakers to:

Measure financial risk exposure, and

Quantify the effectiveness of risk-hedging policies.

This project bridges that gap by developing a unified analytical framework that measures both policy efficacy and residual risk disparity across countries and time periods.

🚀 Solution: Key Metrics & Dashboard Structure

The final solution is a four-page Power BI dashboard focused on two critical KPIs:

Adjustment Effectiveness (%) – Evaluates the success rate of the implemented risk mitigation mechanism.

Residual Risk Disparity (%) – Measures the uneven distribution of inflation risk among countries.

🧭 Dashboard Pages

Strategic Summary: Overview of global trends and mechanism performance.

Operational Risk Hotspots: Identifies volatility-prone regions and seasons.

Mechanism Effectiveness: Compares Raw Rate vs Adjusted Rate for KPI validation.

Deep Dive Analysis: Highlights extreme outliers and disparity patterns.

🎯 Key Findings & Project Success
Finding Category	Key Insight	Data Point
Policy Success Rate	The risk mitigation mechanism reduced maximum inflation exposure.	Adjustment Effectiveness: 90.00%
Residual Risk	Large disparity between highest and lowest risk categories highlights the impact of outliers.	Residual Risk Disparity: 33,203.18%
Top Hotspot	Risk is highly concentrated — one country contributes over half of the total inflation sum.	Armenia: 51.63% contribution
Temporal Risk	Volatility follows a consistent annual pattern, enabling proactive policy timing.	Peak Month: October

🔮 Future Scope

To enhance analytical depth and predictive intelligence, the following upgrades are proposed:

🤖 Machine Learning Integration: Apply models like ARIMA or Prophet for 12–24 month inflation forecasting.

💹 External Factors Correlation: Integrate commodity prices and interest rate data to explore causal relationships.

🧭 Advanced Navigation: Add drill-through functionality for country-level deep dives and time-based filtering.

💻 Usage Instructions
