# 📊 Global Inflation Risk Analysis Dashboard
## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Global Inflation Risk Analysis Dashboard** is a comprehensive Data Analytics project built using **Microsoft Power BI**, designed to analyze and visualize global inflation rates from **1980 to 2024**.

This project transforms complex, unstructured macroeconomic data into a **multi-page interactive dashboard**, providing actionable insights into volatility trends, geographic risk concentration, and the performance of key risk mitigation mechanisms.

---

### ❗ Problem Statement

Global inflation datasets are often **unstructured, wide-format, and highly volatile**, making it challenging for analysts and policymakers to:

- Measure financial risk exposure  
- Quantify the effectiveness of risk-hedging policies  

This project addresses these challenges by developing a **unified analytical framework** that measures both policy efficacy and residual risk disparity across countries and time periods.

---

### 🚀 Solution: Key Metrics & Dashboard Structure

The final solution is a **four-page Power BI dashboard** focusing on two critical KPIs:

- **Adjustment Effectiveness (%)** – Evaluates the success rate of implemented risk mitigation mechanisms  
- **Residual Risk Disparity (%)** – Measures the uneven distribution of inflation risk among countries  

#### 🧭 Dashboard Pages

1. **Strategic Summary** – Overview of global trends and mechanism performance  
2. **Operational Risk Hotspots** – Identifies volatility-prone regions and seasons  
3. **Mechanism Effectiveness** – Compares Raw Rate vs Adjusted Rate for KPI validation  
4. **Deep Dive Analysis** – Highlights extreme outliers and disparity patterns

### 🎯 Key Findings

| Finding Category | Key Insight | Data Point |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| Policy Success Rate | Risk mitigation mechanism reduced maximum inflation exposure | Adjustment Effectiveness: 90.00% |
| Residual Risk | Large disparity between highest and lowest risk categories | Residual Risk Disparity: 33,203.18% |
| Top Hotspot | Risk is highly concentrated — one country contributes over half of total inflation | Armenia: 51.63% contribution |
| Temporal Risk | Volatility follows a consistent annual pattern | Peak Month: October |
