# 🌍 Inflation Odyssey | Power BI Global Inflation Analysis

Welcome to **Inflation Odyssey** — an interactive Power BI project that explores global inflation patterns across countries and continents. Through dynamic visualizations and structured data modeling, this dashboard helps multinational stakeholders understand inflation trends, assess economic risks, and make data-driven strategic decisions.

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project simulates how a multinational corporation can utilize inflation insights to:

- Optimize pricing strategies across regions
- Forecast risks based on historical inflation patterns
- Compare inflation categories (high/moderate/low) over time
- Make informed investment decisions aligned with local economies
